        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing 
        the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML 
        or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is 
        a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.. 
        The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML 
        and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of 
        CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, 
        known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using 
        the canvas element, together with JavaScript.
